# Tomuhs_Blackjack is a blackjack card game 
...that im trying to build with python, as im learning it, to exercise and learn.)
Cards are not yet implemented, everything is yet working thanks to random factor. (For example : There are unlimited amount of "2s" you can choose, the "dealer" wont run out of them)
